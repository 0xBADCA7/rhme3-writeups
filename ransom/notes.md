### main_313
Init loop calls sub_2b2() 8x times
	- 7f00 -> e238
	- iterator is Y[1:2]
	- stores result in Y + 9 + 2*iterator
	-> looks like keygen for unlock code

### xrefs
sub_909 is called with 0x2221
	- which is random bytes, populated from somewhere..

## Dynamic Work
Goals:
	- find userid, make sure it matches

breakpoints:
	0x407: userid
<code>
data 0x2170  79 21 0a 00 00 54 6f 20 67 65 74 20 79 6f 75 72  y!...To get your
data 0x2180  20 63 61 72 20 62 61 63 6b 2c 20 73 65 6e 64 20   car back, send 
data 0x2190  79 6f 75 72 20 75 73 65 72 20 49 44 3a 0a 46 46  your user ID:.FF
data 0x21A0  46 46 46 46 46 46 46 46 46 46 46 46 46 46 0a 00  FFFFFFFFFFFFFF..
</code>
So:
	1. Userid is in NVM: value: ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff
		- sub_632() copies to 0x3fd4
		-> 11 bytes long!
	2. memcpy tail 8 bytes
		- 0x3fd7 -> 0x3fba
	3. sprintf using "%02x" in sub_268()
		- 0x3fba -> 0x3fc3 (16 bytes, duh) (yes, null terminated)
	* Userid can be found at 0x3fc3 (as a hex string)
	* And should be: 3835320716000D00
		- first three bytes are "852"
	* After init completes, the following bits are lying around:
		- 267EDED9BE5494D85449088FD41F38E2
	* Altering hidden three bytes of userid doesn't change unlock code

Our input code gets written to:
	0x3f78, max 32 bytes, including null terminator

Things to do:
	* NOP 0x1ab (starting at 0x356, because bytes vs words)
	* break on 0x330
		- set  3fd7 to userid
	* break on 0x407
		- watch printf
	* break on 0x42d
		- is the read -> 0x3f78
		- put target text there
		- and skip it

Notes:
	* Calling sub_769() the first time major changes to 0x3f18...0x3f58
		- but that's probably my stack?
	* similarly, there was a change to 0x3f58...0x3f60 before exit
		- more stack
	* again, same thing

## Summary
First we did static analysis, from which we found the serial prints and the serial reads, but we misunderstood the busy-wait code and thought we would need to reverse that. So, instead of doing so, we set up a simulation environment leveraging Atmel Studio 7.

Key Process:
Tools -> Device Programming -> Simulator / ATxmega128A4U
Production file, Save to ELF production file, Flash: <target>.hex
Tick the Flash box
Save

File -> Open -> Open Object File for Debugging
Select the Object File To Debug: <target>.elf

Once that was complete, we noticed that in the simulator, it was printing out a null userid "FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF". We traced that back to see where it was coming from, and found that in `sub_632()`, it was being read from NVM. Interestingly, 11 bytes were read, but only 8 used. Hoping the other three didn't matter, we overwrote the 8, and let it continue.

The next major stage of initialization used the userid to create a 16 byte random-looking bytestream, which was then sprintf()d into hex and stored on the stack. This looked a lot like a flag to use... no dice. Next, it looked a lot like the ransom-unlock code... worked.
